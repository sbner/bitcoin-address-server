# bitcoin-address-server
Golang server for the bitcoin-address project.

This project is intended to be the rest server for the [bitcoin-address project](https://github.com/sbner/bitcoin-address "bitcoin-address repo").

## Some useful info

This was my first GOlang proect, I've found it to be quite friendly for a developer with some knowledge and other languages background. 
During development I faced some CORS issues, so because of that I had to disable it. In production this would absolutely not recomended due to safety concerns.

Run the following code to execute the server on localhost:8000

## `go run main.go`
